An independent study in mathematical systems theory

This repository contains materials for an independent study in discrete math aimed at helping students develop comfort with basic mathematical concepts used in mathematical systems theory. The emphasis is on gaining familiarity with standard mathematical notation and language along with essential ideas that facilitate an understanding of formal systems as a bridge between mathematics and natural language. 

Key Topics Include

## Set Theory
* Power sets
* Set complements
* Set differences

## Binary Relations and functions
* Function Composition

## Linear Algebra
* Matrix operations
* The relationship between the structure of matrices and fuzzy logic

## Graph Theory
* Directed and undirected graphs
* Operations on adjacency matrices

## Partial Orders and Lattices
* The relationship between order theory and hierarchy, seeing partial orders as a way to formalize the notion of hierarchy
